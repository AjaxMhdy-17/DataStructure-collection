LinkedList

linkedList : Linked list is linear data structure like array. linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location. the elements are linked using pointer.
A Linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list.
The first node is called the head. if the linked list is empty then the value of head pointer is null .

Each Node Has Two Parts : 
data -> we can store integer , string or any type of data inside data part.
pointer -> reference to the next node connect one node to another 


class Node{
	constructor(val){
		this.data = val 
		this.next = null 
	}
}

var head = new Node(1) 
var second = new Node(3) 
var third = new Node(5) 

head.next = second 
second.next = third 


function printList(){
	var n = head ;
	while(n != null){
		console.log(n.data) 
		n = n.next 
	}
}

printList()
